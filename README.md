A lot of programmers have given up learning Rust because of the error messages it generates. Furthermore, the concept of borrowing and ownership are relatively new and many aren't able to climb this "steep learning curve".

Although tools currently exist to improve code quality in terms of indentation, performance etc. there aren't much tools in cargo which can handle a panicking developer.

This is my humble attempt at generating a motivational text generator for a beginner learning Rust to keep going on this journey.

Install: `cargo install cargo-jdi`

Usage: `cargo jdi`

Reminder: Just do it! Nothing is impossible!.
